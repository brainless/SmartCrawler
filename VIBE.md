# This project was mostly vibe coded

## First version was created with Claude Code
### Initial prompt

> Please create a crawler and scraper in Rust. You can use any crates you want. The crawler will be given an objective and list of domains via command prompt. Objective may ask for existence of some information or list of extracted data or similar. The crawler should find the sitemap for any domain and ask Claude which URLs make most sense to crawl for the given objective. The crawler should be conservative in   crawling and try to use Claude to reach results fast.

The first version did not handle when sitemap file is not found, so I tried:

> If a sitemap file is not found for a domain, can you generate a SiteMap from the links hierarchy found from the homepage or other pages? Then refer to this SiteMap as you continue crawling and base your decisions on it.

This did not work well, the way Claude wrote the code was to first crawl a bunch of URLs to generate a possible sitemap. It does not work, not sure why but it would also defeat the goal of a conservative crawl.

Here are the next prompts I tried:

> Regarding CrawlerConfig.domains, will it work if domains get added while the domains are being crawled in the loop in SmartCrawler::crawl_all_domains?

> Can we update CrawlerConfig.domains so that domains can be added while existing domains are being crawled in the loop in SmartCrawler::crawl_all_domains?

> Please modify ClaudeClient::select_urls to accept urls of type SitemapUrl or just regular URLs.

> In SmartCrawler keep track of all the URLs that are being scraped for each domain in the function crawl_domain. Only unique URLs allowed.

> In SmartCrawler::crawl_domain if sitemap_urls.is_empty then we should not return immediately. Instead we should use the root URL for the domain and start with it.

> In ClaudeClient::select_urls please update prompt to only return URLs that in the existing list of urls argument. Also please check the response from Claude and ignore return URLs that are not in the existing list of urls.

> In ClaudeClient::select_urls please add an info log of the urls argument.

> In SmartCrawler::crawl_domain if sitemap_urls.is_empty then we should take the root url of the domain and scrape that URL to get all the URLs in it.

## GitHub Actions Release Workflow Implementation

### User Request
Create GitHub Actions workflow to build releases for Linux, Mac OS and Windows. Please generate native installers where available. It would be nice to be able to manage versions easily. If it cannot be automated then please add a release management documentation explaining the release process.

### Task Plan
1. Create feature branch for release workflow
2. Save task plan to VIBE.md (this section)
3. Create comprehensive release workflow with:
   - Multi-platform builds (Linux x64, macOS x64/ARM64, Windows x64)
   - Native installers where possible (MSI for Windows, DMG for macOS, DEB/RPM for Linux)
   - Automated version management via git tags
   - Release artifact uploads
   - Release notes generation
4. Add automated version management system
5. Create release management documentation
6. Test the release workflow

### Implementation Details
- Use GitHub Actions matrix strategy for cross-platform builds
- Leverage rust-toolchain for consistent Rust versions
- Use cargo-wix for Windows MSI installer
- Use create-dmg for macOS DMG packages  
- Use cargo-deb and cargo-rpm for Linux packages
- Implement semantic versioning with git tags
- Auto-generate changelogs from commit messages
- Upload all artifacts to GitHub Releases

## GitHub Actions Cross-Compilation Fix - Issue #9

### User Request
Please check issue #9 on GitHub and see if you can fix it.

### Issue Analysis
GitHub issue #9 reported a failure in the GitHub Actions workflow during binary preparation:
- Error: `strip: Unable to recognise the format of the input file 'smart-crawler'`
- Occurred when building for ARM64 Linux (`aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`) target
- Root cause: x86_64 `strip` command cannot process ARM64 binaries

### Task Plan
1. Create new branch for GitHub issue #9 fix
2. Update VIBE.md with task details (this section)
3. Fix cross-compilation strip issue in release workflow:
   - Install cross-compilation binutils for ARM64
   - Use target-specific strip tools (aarch64-linux-gnu-strip)
   - Add graceful fallback if strip tools unavailable
   - Enhanced error handling and logging
4. Commit the cross-compilation strip fix
5. Push branch for PR creation

### Implementation Details
- Added `binutils-aarch64-linux-gnu` package installation
- Implemented target-specific strip command selection:
  - ARM64 Linux: `aarch64-linux-gnu-strip`
  - x86_64 Linux: `strip`
  - macOS (both): `strip`
  - Windows: skip (not applicable)
- Added error checking and informative logging
- Updated RELEASE.md troubleshooting documentation

## Missing Installer Packages Fix

### User Request
I cannot see the msi, dmg, deb or rpm files in the latest releases even though there are steps in the release.yml GitHub Actions workflow. Can you please check and fix?

### Issue Analysis
The release workflow includes a `build-installers` job but the installer packages are not appearing in GitHub releases. Potential causes:
- Installer build job may be failing silently
- Dependencies for installer tools may be missing
- File paths or naming issues in the upload process
- Job dependencies or matrix configuration problems

### Task Plan
1. Create new branch for installer packages fix
2. Update VIBE.md with task details (this section)
3. Investigate missing installer packages in releases:
   - Review workflow logs for installer job failures
   - Check installer build steps and dependencies
   - Verify file paths and upload commands
4. Fix installer build workflow issues:
   - Ensure all installer tools are properly installed
   - Fix any path or dependency issues
   - Improve error handling and logging
5. Test and commit the fixes

### Expected Implementation
- Verify and fix Windows MSI installer generation
- Verify and fix macOS DMG package creation
- Verify and fix Linux DEB package generation  
- Verify and fix Linux RPM package generation
- Ensure all packages upload correctly to releases

## GitHub Actions PowerShell Syntax Fix - Issue #12

### User Request
Please check issue #12 on GitHub and see if you can fix it. Please use development workflow as in Claude.md

### Issue Analysis
GitHub issue #12 reports a GitHub Actions workflow failure with PowerShell syntax error:
- Error: "Missing expression after unary operator '--'"
- Occurs during "Build Release for Windows x64" job
- Command: `gh release upload v0.2.5 \ ... --repo "brainless/SmartCrawler"`
- Root cause: PowerShell multiline command continuation syntax issue

### Task Plan
1. Create new branch for GitHub issue #12 fix
2. Update VIBE.md with task details (this section)
3. Investigate PowerShell syntax error in release workflow:
   - Examine the problematic gh release upload command
   - Identify line continuation and escaping issues
   - Check shell context (bash vs PowerShell)
4. Fix the gh release upload command syntax:
   - Ensure proper PowerShell multiline syntax
   - Use correct shell for the command execution
   - Test command syntax compatibility
5. Test the fix and commit changes

### Implementation Details
- The error occurs because PowerShell interprets backslash differently than bash
- Need to either use PowerShell-compatible line continuation or force bash shell
- Will use explicit shell specification to ensure consistent behavior
- May need to restructure the command for better cross-platform compatibility

## Cargo-deb Asset Path Fix - Issue #14

### User Request
Can you please check issue #14 on GitHub and see if you can fix it. Please use development workflow as in Claude.md

### Issue Analysis
GitHub issue #14 reports a GitHub Actions workflow failure during DEB package building:
- Error: "TOML parse error at line 29, column 10"
- Message: "Please only use `target/release` path prefix for built products"
- Location: `Cargo.toml` DEB package configuration
- Root cause: Using hardcoded cross-compilation path instead of standard path

### Task Plan
1. Create new branch for GitHub issue #14 fix
2. Update VIBE.md with task details (this section)
3. Investigate cargo-deb TOML parse error:
   - Examine the problematic asset path in Cargo.toml
   - Understand cargo-deb path requirements
   - Identify cross-compilation compatibility issues
4. Fix DEB package asset path in Cargo.toml:
   - Change from target-specific path to standard target/release
   - Let cargo-deb handle cross-compilation paths automatically
   - Ensure compatibility with GitHub Actions workflow
5. Test the fix and commit changes

### Implementation Details
- The issue is in the [package.metadata.deb] assets configuration
- Current path: "target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/smart-crawler"
- Required path: "target/release/smart-crawler"
- cargo-deb will automatically handle cross-compilation target paths
- This maintains compatibility while following cargo-deb best practices

## Cargo-rpm File Path Fix - Issue #16

### User Request
Can you please check issue #16 on GitHub and see if you can fix it. Please use development workflow as in Claude.md

### Issue Analysis
GitHub issue #16 reports a GitHub Actions workflow failure during RPM package building:
- Error: "cp: cannot stat 'target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/rpm/RPMS/x86_64/*.rpm': No such file or directory"
- Location: GitHub Actions workflow RPM build step
- Root cause: cargo-rpm may not generate files in the expected target-specific path
- Issue occurs when trying to copy the generated RPM file

### Task Plan
1. Create new branch for GitHub issue #16 fix
2. Update VIBE.md with task details (this section)
3. Investigate cargo-rpm build and file location issue:
   - Examine the problematic file copy path in workflow
   - Research cargo-rpm default output locations
   - Understand how cargo-rpm handles cross-compilation paths
4. Fix RPM package file path in GitHub Actions workflow:
   - Update workflow to look in correct cargo-rpm output directory
   - Add better error handling and file discovery
   - Ensure compatibility with cargo-rpm behavior
5. Test the fix and commit changes

### Implementation Details
- Current failing path: "target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/rpm/RPMS/x86_64/*.rpm"
- cargo-rpm likely generates files in "target/rpm/" or "target/generate-rpm/"
- Need to investigate actual cargo-rpm output structure
- Will add file discovery logic to handle different cargo-rpm versions
- May need to use glob patterns or find commands for robustness
