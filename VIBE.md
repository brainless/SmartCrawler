# This project was mostly vibe coded

## First version was created with Claude Code
### Initial prompt

> Please create a crawler and scraper in Rust. You can use any crates you want. The crawler will be given an objective and list of domains via command prompt. Objective may ask for existence of some information or list of extracted data or similar. The crawler should find the sitemap for any domain and ask Claude which URLs make most sense to crawl for the given objective. The crawler should be conservative in   crawling and try to use Claude to reach results fast.

The first version did not handle when sitemap file is not found, so I tried:

> If a sitemap file is not found for a domain, can you generate a SiteMap from the links hierarchy found from the homepage or other pages? Then refer to this SiteMap as you continue crawling and base your decisions on it.

This did not work well, the way Claude wrote the code was to first crawl a bunch of URLs to generate a possible sitemap. It does not work, not sure why but it would also defeat the goal of a conservative crawl.

Here are the next prompts I tried:

> Regarding CrawlerConfig.domains, will it work if domains get added while the domains are being crawled in the loop in SmartCrawler::crawl_all_domains?

> Can we update CrawlerConfig.domains so that domains can be added while existing domains are being crawled in the loop in SmartCrawler::crawl_all_domains?

> Please modify ClaudeClient::select_urls to accept urls of type SitemapUrl or just regular URLs.

> In SmartCrawler keep track of all the URLs that are being scraped for each domain in the function crawl_domain. Only unique URLs allowed.

> In SmartCrawler::crawl_domain if sitemap_urls.is_empty then we should not return immediately. Instead we should use the root URL for the domain and start with it.

> In ClaudeClient::select_urls please update prompt to only return URLs that in the existing list of urls argument. Also please check the response from Claude and ignore return URLs that are not in the existing list of urls.

> In ClaudeClient::select_urls please add an info log of the urls argument.

> In SmartCrawler::crawl_domain if sitemap_urls.is_empty then we should take the root url of the domain and scrape that URL to get all the URLs in it.

- May need to use glob patterns or find commands for robustness

## Crawler Improvements Implementation - Issue #19

### User Request
Can you please check ideas in #19 on GitHub and implement them. Please use development workflow as in Claude.md

### Issue Analysis
GitHub issue #19 suggests several improvements to enhance the SmartCrawler's URL handling and LLM interaction:

1. **URL Tracking Enhancement**: Track URLs per domain storing only path and query parameters
2. **LLM Interaction Improvement**: Send only path/query to LLM, handle domain separately
3. **Objective-based URL Expansion**: Add URLs matching original objective words after filtering

### Task Plan
1. Create new branch for GitHub issue #19 improvements
2. Update VIBE.md with task details (this section)
3. Implement URL tracking improvements in SmartCrawler:
   - Modify URL storage to track path+query per domain
   - Update deduplication logic for improved efficiency
4. Update LLM prompt to handle domain separately:
   - Modify LLM trait default implementation
   - Update prompt to receive domain context separately from URL paths
5. Add objective-based URL expansion logic:
   - Implement keyword matching against objective
   - Add URLs that match objective terms after select_urls_one_level_deeper
6. Test and commit the improvements

### Implementation Details
- URL storage: Use HashMap<String, HashSet<String>> where key=domain, value=path+query
- LLM prompt: Pass domain context separately, send clean path/query list
- Objective matching: Parse objective for keywords, match against URL paths
- Performance: Reduce memory usage by storing partial URLs instead of full URLs
- Accuracy: Improve LLM decisions with cleaner, domain-contextualized prompts

- Track total scroll time to enforce 10-second limit
- Detect when page bottom is reached to avoid unnecessary scrolling
- Ensure graceful handling of scroll failures or timeouts
- Log scrolling progress for debugging and monitoring

## Typed Entity Extraction Implementation

### User Request
"In the crawler, I want to get data that is typed. So if objective needs people, then we should give a struct that is People with first and last name, etc. Please create data types for common entities that describe real world entities like People, Date, Event, Location, etc."

### Task Plan
1. Create new branch for typed entity extraction feature
2. Update VIBE.md with task details (this section)
