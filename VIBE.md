# This project was mostly vibe coded

## First version was created with Claude Code
### Initial prompt

> Please create a crawler and scraper in Rust. You can use any crates you want. The crawler will be given an objective and list of domains via command prompt. Objective may ask for existence of some information or list of extracted data or similar. The crawler should find the sitemap for any domain and ask Claude which URLs make most sense to crawl for the given objective. The crawler should be conservative in   crawling and try to use Claude to reach results fast.

The first version did not handle when sitemap file is not found, so I tried:

> If a sitemap file is not found for a domain, can you generate a SiteMap from the links hierarchy found from the homepage or other pages? Then refer to this SiteMap as you continue crawling and base your decisions on it.

This did not work well, the way Claude wrote the code was to first crawl a bunch of URLs to generate a possible sitemap. It does not work, not sure why but it would also defeat the goal of a conservative crawl.

Here are the next prompts I tried:

> Regarding CrawlerConfig.domains, will it work if domains get added while the domains are being crawled in the loop in SmartCrawler::crawl_all_domains?

> Can we update CrawlerConfig.domains so that domains can be added while existing domains are being crawled in the loop in SmartCrawler::crawl_all_domains?

> Please modify ClaudeClient::select_urls to accept urls of type SitemapUrl or just regular URLs.

> In SmartCrawler keep track of all the URLs that are being scraped for each domain in the function crawl_domain. Only unique URLs allowed.

> In SmartCrawler::crawl_domain if sitemap_urls.is_empty then we should not return immediately. Instead we should use the root URL for the domain and start with it.

> In ClaudeClient::select_urls please update prompt to only return URLs that in the existing list of urls argument. Also please check the response from Claude and ignore return URLs that are not in the existing list of urls.

> In ClaudeClient::select_urls please add an info log of the urls argument.

> In SmartCrawler::crawl_domain if sitemap_urls.is_empty then we should take the root url of the domain and scrape that URL to get all the URLs in it.

## Improve URL Selection Logic - Issue #27

### User Request
Implement improved URL selection logic that uses LLM to generate keywords based on the crawling objective, then ranks URLs by keyword relevance before LLM selection.

### Issue Analysis
For websites with large numbers of URLs from sitemaps or homepages, the current approach sends too many URLs to the LLM for selection. This can be inefficient and may not yield the best results.

### Task Plan
1. Create new branch for GitHub issue #27 improvements
2. Update VIBE.md with task details (this section)
3. Add new LLM method `generate_keywords()` to extract relevant keywords from objective
4. Implement URL scoring and ranking system based on keyword matches:
   - Score URLs by keyword matches in path, query parameters, and URL structure
   - Sort URLs by relevance score before sending to LLM
   - Limit URLs sent to LLM to top X candidates (where X = max_urls * multiplier)
5. Integrate two-stage URL selection process into crawler:
   - Stage 1: Keyword-based filtering and ranking
   - Stage 2: LLM-based final selection from top candidates
6. Add configuration options for keyword-based filtering parameters
7. Test with various objectives and URL sets
8. Ensure backward compatibility with existing URL selection logic

### Implementation Details
- `generate_keywords()` method: Extract 5-10 relevant keywords from crawling objective
- URL scoring algorithm: Score based on keyword matches, path depth, and structure
- Ranking system: Sort URLs by score, take top N candidates for LLM selection
- Two-stage selection: Keyword filtering → LLM selection for higher quality results
- Configuration: Add multiplier setting for candidate URL limit (e.g., max_urls * 3)

### Expected Benefits
- Better URL selection quality through objective-specific keyword pre-filtering
- Reduced LLM API calls and costs by sending fewer, more relevant URLs
- Faster crawling with more targeted URL selection
- Improved handling of large sitemaps and homepage link collections
- Maintained accuracy while improving efficiency
